## Features

- Moderator power limited by design
- No ads
- US-based servers
- Mobile friendly
- Dark mode

## Why Ruqqus?

A moderator has the power to "kick" a user-submitted post from their community (guild) but never delete it off the platform entirely. Kicked posts end up in a catch-all guild called [+general](https://ruqqus.com/+general). Content that violates the [site-wide policy](https://ruqqus.com/help/terms) is removed by the core team.

Moderators, called guild masters, can only moderate a maximum of 10 guilds.

We do not serve ads. Put simply, advertisements lead to censorship. Ruqqus is funded out-of-pocket by the core team and through donations from users.

Ruqqus is responsive and mobile browser-friendly.

## Local development

### Docker Deployment

In order to build your docs, you need to add the following to your hosts file:

```
127.0.0.1    ruqqus.localhost
```
Before deploying, make sure to compile .scss files in `ruqqus/assets/style/` with a package called "sass" (or ruby-sass)

To deploy the stack with docker, simply use:

```
docker-compose up
```

The database will automatically be seeded with an administrator account; user `ruqqie` and password `password`.

### Mac

Install dependencies

`$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`$ brew install redis`

`$ brew install postgres`

## Local development

### [Mac](https://github.com/ruqqus/ruqqus/wiki/Mac-Installation)

### [Linux](https://github.com/ruqqus/ruqqus/wiki/Linux-Installation)

Upon installation, trying to submit a post will cause a 404 error. You have to create a guild first (to achieve this perhaps temporarily remove the 250 rep restriction on making guilds). You also need to make sure the badwords table is populated.

Note: When trying to run Ruqqus locally, make sure to use a [tagged release version](https://github.com/ruqqus/ruqqus/releases). The reason this is necessary is that the file schema.txt is not always updated, which will cause Ruqqus to crash. If after first setting up Ruqqus you are getting a 500/Internal Server Error on pages because of database errors, this is most likely why.
